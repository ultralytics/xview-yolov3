# üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the Ultralytics `xview-yolov3` repository! This project provides the necessary code and instructions to train the powerful [Ultralytics YOLOv3](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov3/) object detection model on the challenging [xView dataset](https://challenge.xviewdataset.org/). The primary goal is to support participants in the [xView Challenge](https://challenge.xviewdataset.org/), which focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art in detecting objects within [satellite imagery](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/using-computer-vision-to-analyse-satellite-imagery), a critical application of [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) in remote sensing.

# üì¶ Requirements

To successfully run this project, ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites:

- **Python:** Version 3.6 or later. You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Dependencies:** Install the required packages using pip. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Key dependencies include:

- `numpy`: Essential for numerical operations in Python.
- `scipy`: Provides algorithms for scientific and technical computing.
- `torch`: The core [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) library for deep learning.
- `opencv-python`: The [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library for computer vision tasks.
- `h5py`: Enables interaction with data stored in HDF5 format.
- `tqdm`: A utility for displaying progress bars in loops and command-line interfaces.

# üì• Download Data

Begin by downloading the necessary xView dataset files. You can obtain the data directly from the [xView Challenge data download page](https://challenge.xviewdataset.org/data-download). Ensure you have sufficient storage space, as satellite imagery datasets can be quite large.

# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training

Training the YOLOv3 model on the xView dataset involves preprocessing the data and then running the training script.

## Preprocessing Steps

Before initiating the training process, we perform several preprocessing steps on the target labels to enhance model performance:

1.  **Outlier Removal:** Outliers in the dataset are identified and removed using sigma-rejection to clean the data.
2.  **Anchor Generation:** A new set of 30 [k-means anchors](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/anchor-based-detectors) are generated specifically tailored for the `c60_a30symmetric.cfg` configuration file. This process utilizes the MATLAB script `utils/analysis.m`. The generated anchors help the model better predict bounding boxes of various sizes and aspect ratios present in the xView dataset.

## Starting the Training

Once the xView data is downloaded and placed in the expected directory, you can **start training** by executing the `train.py` script. You will need to configure the path to your xView data within the script:

- Modify line 41 for local machine execution.
- Modify line 43 if you are training in a cloud environment like [Google Colab](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/google-colab/) or [Kaggle](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/kaggle/).

```bash
python train.py
```

## Resuming Training

If your training session is interrupted, you can easily **resume training** from the last saved checkpoint. Use the `--resume` flag as shown below:

```bash
python train.py --resume 1
```

The script will automatically load the weights from the `latest.pt` file located in the `checkpoints/` directory and continue the training process.

## Training Details

During each training epoch, the system processes 8 randomly sampled 608x608 pixel chips extracted from each full-resolution image in the dataset. On hardware like an Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti, you can typically complete around 100 epochs per day.

Be mindful of [overfitting](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/overfitting), which can become a significant issue after approximately 200 epochs. Monitoring validation metrics is crucial. The best observed validation mean Average Precision ([mAP](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/mean-average-precision-map)) in experiments was 0.16 after 300 epochs (roughly 3 days of training), corresponding to a training mAP of 0.30.

Monitor the training progress by observing the loss plots for bounding box regression, objectness, and class confidence. These plots should ideally show decreasing trends, similar to the example below:

### Image Augmentation üì∏

To improve model robustness and generalization, the `datasets.py` script applies various [data augmentations](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/data-augmentation) to the full-resolution input images during training using OpenCV. The specific augmentations and their parameters are:

| Augmentation   | Description                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Translation    | +/- 1% (vertical and horizontal)          |
| Rotation       | +/- 20 degrees                            |
| Shear          | +/- 3 degrees (vertical and horizontal)   |
| Scale          | +/- 30%                                   |
| Reflection     | 50% probability (vertical and horizontal) |
| HSV Saturation | +/- 50%                                   |
| HSV Intensity  | +/- 50%                                   |

**Note:** Augmentation is applied **only** during the training phase. During inference or validation, the original, unaugmented images are used. The corresponding [bounding box](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/bounding-box) coordinates are automatically adjusted to match the transformations applied to the images. Explore more augmentation techniques with [Albumentations](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/albumentations/).

# üîç Inference

After training completes, the model checkpoints (`.pt` files) containing the learned weights are saved in the `checkpoints/` directory. You can use the `detect.py` script to perform [inference](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/) on new or existing xView images using your trained model.

For example, to run detection on the image `5.tif` from the training set using the best performing weights (`best.pt`), you would run:

```bash
python detect.py --weights checkpoints/best.pt --source path/to/5.tif
```

The script will process the image, detect objects, draw bounding boxes, and save the output image. An example output might look like this:
