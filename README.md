# üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the [Ultralytics xView YOLOv3](https://github.com/ultralytics/xview-yolov3) repository! This repository enables you to train a state-of-the-art object detection model, YOLOv3, using the comprehensive xView dataset for object detection in satellite imagery. Take the xView challenge at https://challenge.xviewdataset.org/ and push the boundaries of aerial image analysis using machine learning.

## üîß Requirements

To run the codebase, your system needs to have Python 3.6 or later. First, install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Here's a list of key dependencies:
- numpy
- scipy
- torch
- opencv-python
- h5py
- tqdm

## üì° Download Data

Get the xView dataset by registering and downloading the challenge data from https://challenge.xviewdataset.org/data-download.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training

To start training the YOLOv3 model on the xView dataset, you'll need to perform a bit of housekeeping on the target labels to ensure they're clean and outlier-free. Use the sigma-rejection method and recompute anchors based on the k-means algorithm, tailored for the `c60_a30symmetric.cfg`. The MATLAB file `utils/analysis.m` can help with this task:

### Start Training
Run the `train.py` script to kick-off the training process. Make sure you have specified the xView data path in the script (line 41 for local paths or line 43 for cloud storage paths).

```bash
python train.py
```

### Resume Training
If you ever need to pick up where you left off, you can resume training from the latest saved checkpoint, `latest.pt`, by using the -resume flag:

```bash
python train.py --resume 1
```

Training is vigorous, with each epoch processing eight 608x608 sized chips randomly sampled from augmented full-resolution images. With a modern GPU, like an Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti, you can expect around 100 epochs per day. Watch for the loss plots for bounding boxes, objectness, and class confidence to stabilize, as overfitting can become an issue after 200 epochs.

### Training Observations
Expect to see your best validation mAP reach 0.16 after 300 epochs, approximately 3 days of continuous training, which correlates with a training mAP of 0.30, as depicted below:

#### Image Augmentation
The `datasets.py` script enriches training images with various transformations powered by OpenCV. Note that these augmentations are applied **only** during training and not inference. Here's what's happening under the hood:

| Augmentation         | Description                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Translation          | +/- 1% (vertical and horizontal)              |
| Rotation             | +/- 20 degrees                                |
| Shear                | +/- 3 degrees (vertical and horizontal)       |
| Scale                | +/- 30%                                       |
| Reflection           | 50% probability (vertical and horizontal)     |
| H**S**V Saturation   | +/- 50%                                       |
| HS**V** Intensity    | +/- 50%                                       |

## üîç Inference

For deploying your trained model, checkpoints will be stored in the `/checkpoints` directory. Use the `detect.py` script to run inference on images like `5.tif` from the dataset:

```bash
python detect.py
```
